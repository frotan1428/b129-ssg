        1)To create an "Array" we need to declare "the number of elements" at the beginning,
        we may need more elements to store or less elements to store inside the array.
        That is why declaring the number of elements at the beginning is not good.
        This is the negative side of arrays.

        To remove that negativity, Java created a new structure whose name is "ArrayList"(List is also used),
        when we use "ArrayList", no need to declare the number of elements you want to store in it.

        As a result; "Array" is fixed in length, "ArrayList" is flexible

        2) "ArrayList" can store just "non-primitive" data, "Array" can store "primitive" data and "reference"

        3) "Array"s work so fast
        "Array"s use memory so less
        If you are sure the number of elements will not change(For example month names), using "Array" is better

        1) Each element in LinkedList consists of two parts i)Data ii)Pointer.
        2) Each element in LinkedList is called "Node".
        3) LinkedLists are very successful in adding and deleting elements.
        4) LinkedLists are unsuccessful in element search.
        5)3. LinkedList should be used in cases where element addition and element deletion operations will be done frequently due to the 4th and 4th items.
        6)ArrayLists use index LinkedLists do not use index.
        7) Using index is very successful in finding elements. Therefore, it is very difficult to find personnel.
         If you are going to do it, you should use ArrayList.
         8) Deleting and re-indexing ArrayLists makes it work slowly.
